      <p>
        MusicXML is a standard open format for exchanging digital sheet music. It is designed for 
        sharing sheet music files between applications, and for archiving sheet music files for use in the future.
        As of this publication date it is supported by over 200 applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 3.1 is the first version released by the W3C Music Notation Community Group. 
        Previous MusicXML versions were released by the Recordare and MakeMusic 
        companies.</p>

      <h2>MusicXML Schema Files</h2>
      <p>MusicXML 3.1 does not have a specification document separate from its schema files. 
      The schema files for MusicXML 3.1 are available on the GitHub repository at 
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/musicxml/releases/tag/v3.1">https://github.com/w3c/musicxml/releases/tag/v3.1</a>.</p>

      <h2>Changes From MusicXML 3.0</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Licensing Changes</h3>
        <p>MusicXML 3.1 is now licensed under the W3C Community Final Specification 
    Agreement rather than the MusicXML Public License 3.0.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Packaging Changes</h3>
        <p>MusicXML 3.1 now recommends .musicxml rather than .xml as the file 
        extension for uncompressed MusicXML files.</p>
        <p>MusicXML 3.1 adds a new file called mimetype as the first file in the zip container of 
        a compressed MusicXML file. The file is uncompressed and has the string 
		application/vnd.recordare.musicxml as its content.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Schema Additions</h3>
        <p>MusicXML 3.1 adds new features to MusicXML 3.0 score-partwise and score-timewise 
        documents. These changes are included in the musicxml.xsd and to30.xsl 
        files, as well as the following DTD module files.</p>
